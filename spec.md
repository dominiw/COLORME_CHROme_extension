## Notational Conventions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) (Bradner, S., "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997).

The key words "unspecified", "undefined", and "implementation-defined" are to be interpreted as described in the [rationale for the C99 standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf#page=18).

An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST, REQUIRED, or SHALL requirements for the protocols it implements.
An implementation is compliant if it satisfies all the MUST, REQUIRED, and SHALL requirements for the protocols it implements.

## Terminology

| Term              | Definition                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Volume            | A unit of storage that will be made available inside of a CO-managed container, via the CSI.                          |
| Block Volume      | A volume that will appear as a block device inside the container.                                                     |
| Mounted Volume    | A volume that will be mounted using the specified file system and appear as a directory inside the container.         |
| CO                | Container Orchestration system, communicates with Plugins using CSI service RPCs.                                     |
| SP                | Storage Provider, the vendor of a CSI plugin implementation.                                                          |
| RPC               | [Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call).                                         |
| Node              | A host where the user workload will be running, uniquely identifiable from the perspective of a Plugin by a node ID.  |
| Plugin            | Aka “plugin implementation”, a gRPC endpoint that implements the CSI Services.                                        |
| Plugin Supervisor | Process that governs the lifecycle of a Plugin, MAY be the CO.                                                        |
| Workload          | The atomic unit of "work" scheduled by a CO. This MAY be a container or a collection of containers.                   |

## Objective

To define an industry standard “Container Storage Interface” (CSI) that will enable storage vendors (SP) to develop a plugin once and have it work across a number of container orchestration (CO) systems.

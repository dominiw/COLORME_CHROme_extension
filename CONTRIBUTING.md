# How to Contribute

This document outlines some of the requirements and conventions for contributing to the Container Storage Interface, including development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points, and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Licence and CLA

CSI is under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests.

Before contributing to the Container Storage Interface, contributors MUST sign the CLA available [here](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/CCLA.pdf).
